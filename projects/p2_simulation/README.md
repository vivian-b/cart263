# Project 2 : Virtual pet

In this project, I wished to recreate a well known, classic and simple game. Navigating through jQuery libraries inspired me to make a simulation that is heavily reliant on UI. It led me to think about Tamagotchi and many other small virtual pet games.  However, I may have overestimated myself in being able to execute my ideas correctly.

I had hopes to make this project a bit more special: putting in some easter eggs to make the simulation more fun, unexpected and intriguing. I was not able to implement many of the ideas I had in mind. This simulation is ended up being only the base of a virtual pet game. The user is able to "interact" with their virtual pet by pressing buttons (food, items and others) that affects different bars (hunger/mood/health).

 This project mainly relies on jQuery and many of it's UI features. I had some fun with the CSS (working on layout/grids and buttons) and diving into their the jQuery CSS files to understand and tweak some the elements. The jQuery UI gave me many interactive ideas to implement in this project. However, I am quite disappointed with how the project turned out to be. It did not end up as interactive (pet + owner interaction, quite boring) and genuine (pet feeling less static) as it should[*]. Anyhow, this project still showcase a bit of what we have learned this semester.

 This project (and the semester as a whole) was quite challenging and helped me learn a lot more about how UI works and the links between HTML+CSS+JS.

 [*] I can only blame myself for the severe lack of time and effort I put in this. I will hopefully get back to it as a side project to implement more coding ideas and lessons.
