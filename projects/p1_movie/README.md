# CART-263 Project 1: A Night at the Movies

For this project, I wished to recreate a bit of the universe from TV show called "Hilda". It is a British-Canadian Netflix Original animated television series based on an award-winning British graphic novel series, and a book series created by Luke Pearson.

I loved the show's adventure spirit and characters. I wanted to create a small simulation that also holds a bit of the feeling of adventure and showcase the amazing cast (from the unique characters to the interesting creatures).  And so, I made a small interactive world where the user, playing the role of the main character, Hilda, ventures around the city and the outskirts.

 Similar to an RPG where the player talks to NPCs, the player moves around the canvas with their cursor and can click on the NPC  and read what they have to say. The characters and creatures do not really appear on the map per say, but there is a small dialogue box that pops up when the cursor is near the character's location. A different dialogue inside a larger dialogue box  appears when the user directly interacts with the character or creature. There are four different areas for the user to travel around, hosting 23 different characters and creatures in total around the canvas for the player to hover and click on.

 Overall this is a relaxing and simple simulation for the user to explore a bit of the universe from "Hilda". I fell in love with this shows aesthetics, character personalities and unique creatures and wished for others to have a little glimpse of its world. There isn't really a definite goal or true end to this simulation. It is simply a place to explore around to meet the casts of the show.
